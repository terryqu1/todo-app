  Dear Terry Qu:

  We wanted to let you know about everyday financing options available on your
  Amazon Store Card or Prime Store Card account. As a cardholder, you are
  eligible for one of the following deferred interest financing options when
  you make a qualifying purchase with your store card:

  No Interest if Paid in Full Within 6, 12 or 24 Months.

  For the financing offers described above, if the balance (which includes the
  financing offer purchase amount and related optional debt cancellation
  charges) is not paid in full within the offer period, interest will be
  imposed from the date of purchase at the variable APR that applies to new
  purchases made on your account when the financing offer purchase is made,
  which as of July 21, 2023, is the variable APR of 29.99%. This APR will vary
  with the market based on the prime rate.

  Minimum monthly payments are required. Regular account terms apply to
  non-financing offer purchases and to financing offer purchases after offer
  period ends. Offers are subject to credit approval. This is only a summary
  of key terms. Please see any financing offer advertising or other
  disclosures provided to you for the full terms of any financing options
  offered and keep this notice for your records.

  To learn more about everyday financing offer benefits with the Amazon Store
  Card or Prime Store Card, including special financing and equal monthly
  payments, please visit www.amazon.com/financing.

  We look forward to continuing to service your Amazon Store Card or Prime
  Store Card account.

  Thank you for your business.
